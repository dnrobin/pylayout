# pylayout

A Python 3.0 library for the design of integrated photonics circuits built on the shoulders of the `gdspy` library.

The code was originally written to surmount design-related challenges with arrayed waveguide gratings that were more difficult to achieve with available tools at the time. Since then, the codebase has gradually been improved to include more features and was subsequently used to produce multiple chip designs. The philosophy is greatly inspired by KLayout's scripted macro approach but without the IDE constraint which can slow development.
